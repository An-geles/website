                <p> My name is Anthony Angeles, a third year student studying Computer science and Game Design at UC - Santa Cruz. 
                    I have a specific interest in ML, AI, and the appilication of VR in professional settings. I have interned twice now at Nvidia Inc. as part of the PDE team.
                    Software has always been my strongest suit and my biggest passion, I built this website entierly on my own using HMTL5 and CSS, as well as some React.JS</p>
